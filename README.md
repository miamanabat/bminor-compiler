Bminor Compiler Project
-------------------------------

This was a project completed in CSE 40243 at the University of Notre Dame. Given a C-like language, we wrote different stages of a compiler using tools like flex and bison to ultimately generate a set of assembly instructions. The language we implemented for the compiler, B-minor, includes expressions, basic control flow, recursive functions, and strict type checking. It is object-code compatible with ordinary C and thus can take advantage of the standard C library, within its defined types.

To run the different parts of the compiler:
FLAG = { scan, parse, print, typecheck, codegen }
```
make 
./bminor -FLAG file.bminor
```

To run the code generator:
```
make
./bminor -codegen program.bminor program.s
gcc -g myprogram.s library.c -o myprogram
./myprogram
```

# Language Overview
## Whitespace and Comments
In B-minor, whitespace is any combination of the following characters: tabs, spaces, linefeed (\n), and carriage return (\r). The placement of whitespace is not significant in B-minor. Both C-style and C++-style comments are valid in B-minor:

```
/* A C-style comment */
a=5; // A C++ style comment
```

## Identifiers
Identifiers (i.e. variable and function names) may contain letters, numbers, and underscores. Identifiers must begin with a letter or an underscore. These are examples of valid identifiers:
```
i x mystr fog123 BigLongName55
```
The following strings are B-minor keywords and may not be used as identifiers:
```
array auto boolean char else false for function if integer print return string true void while
```

## Types
B-minor has four atomic types: integers, booleans, characters, and strings. A variable is declared as a name followed by a colon, then a type and an optional initializer. For example:

```
x: integer;
y: integer = 123;
b: boolean = false;
c: char    = 'q';
s: string  = "hello bminor\n";
```
An integer is always a signed 64 bit value. boolean can take the literal values true or false. char is a single 8-bit ASCII character. string is a double-quoted constant string that is null-terminated and cannot be modified.

Both char and string may contain the following backslash codes. \n indicates a linefeed (ASCII value 10), \0 indicates a null (ASCII value zero), and a backslash followed by anything else indicates exactly the following character. Both strings and identifiers may be up to 255 characters long, not including the null terminator.

B-minor also supports arrays of a fixed size. They may be declared with no value, which causes them to contain all zeros:
```
a: array [5] integer;
```
Or, the entire array may be given specific values:
```
a: array [5] integer = {1,2,3,4,5};
```
A variable of type auto indicates an automatic type which is to be inferred by the value given on the right hand side. For example, in the following code, a is of type integer, b is of type string, and c is of type boolean:
```
a: auto = 10;
b: auto = "hello";
c: auto = a < 100;
```

## Expressions
B-minor has many of the arithmetic operators found in C, with the same meaning and level of precedence:
| Symbol |	Meaning |
| ------ | -------- |
| () [] f()	| grouping, array subscript, function call |
| ++ --	| postfix increment, decrement |
| - !	| unary negation, logical not |
| ^	| exponentiation |
| * / %	| multiplication, division, remainder |
| + -	| addition, subtraction |
| < <= > >= == !=	| comparison |
| &&	| logical and |
| \|\|	| logical or |
| = ?:	| assignment, ternary |

B-minor is strictly typed. This means that you may only assign a value to a variable (or function parameter) if the types match exactly. You cannot perform many of the fast-and-loose conversions found in C.

Following are examples of some (but not all) type errors:
```
x: integer = 65;
y: char = 'A';
if(x>y) ... // error: x and y are of different types!

f: integer = 0;
if(f) ...      // error: f is not a boolean!

writechar: function void ( c: char );
a: integer = 65;
writechar(a);  // error: a is not a char!

b: array [2] boolean = {true,false};
x: integer = 0;
x = b[0];      // error: x is not a boolean!
```
Following are some (but not all) examples of correct type assignments:

```
b: boolean;
x: integer = 3;
y: integer = 5;
b = x<y;     // ok: the expression x<y is boolean

f: integer = 0;
if(f==0) ...    // ok: f==0 is a boolean expression

c: char = 'a';
if(c=='a') ...  // ok: c and 'a' are both chars
```

## Declarations and Statements
In B-minor, you may declare global variables with optional constant initializers, function prototypes, and function definitions. Within functions, you may declare local variables (including arrays) with optional initialization expressions. Scoping rules are identical to C. Function definitions may not be nested.

Within functions, basic statements may be arithmetic expressions, return statements, print statements, if and if-else statements, for loops, or code within inner { } groups:

```
// An arithmetic expression statement.
y = m*x + b;

// A return statement.
return (f-32)*5/9;

// An if-else statement.
if( temp>100 ) {
    print "It's really hot!\n";
} else if( temp>70 ) {
    print "It's pretty warm.\n";
} else {
    print "It's not too bad.\n";
}

// A for loop statement.
for( i=0; i<100; i++ ) {
    print i;0
}
```
B-minor does not have switch statements, while-loops, or do-while loops. (But you could consider adding them as a little extra project.)

The print statement is a little unusual because it is a statement and not a function call like printf is in C. print takes a list of expressions separated by commas, and prints each out to the console, like this:
```
print "The temperature is: ", temp, " degrees\n";
```

## Functions
Functions are declared in the same way as variables, except giving a type of function followed by the return type, arguments, and code:
```
square: function integer ( x: integer ) = {
	return x^2;
}
```
The return type must be one of the four atomic types, or void to indicate no type. Function arguments may be of any type. integer, boolean, and char arguments are passed by value, while string and array arguments are passed by reference. As in C, arrays passed by reference have an indeterminate size, and so the length is typically passed as an extra argument:

```
printarray: function void ( a: array [] integer, size: integer ) = {
	i: integer;
	for( i=0;i<size;i++) {
		print a[i], "\n";
	}
}
```
A function prototype may be given, which states the existence and type of the function, but includes no code. This must be done if the user wishes to call an external function linked by another library. For example, to invoke the C function puts:
```
puts: function void ( s: string );

main: function integer () = {
	puts("hello world");
}
```
A complete program must have a main function that returns an integer. the arguments to main may either be empty, or use argc and argv with the same meaning as in C:
```
main: function integer ( argc: integer, argv: array [] string ) = {
        puts("hello world");
}
```

## Other Questions
### Scanning
- Q: Is "" a valid string literal?
- A: Yes, two double quotes represents an empty string consisting only of the null terminator.

- Q: Is this a valid string literal?
```
"hello
world"
```
- A: No, a newline in a string needs to be escaped, like this: "hello\nworld"

- Q: Do we need to handle #include, #define, and so forth?
- A: No, they are not part of B-minor.

- Q: Can an integer have a leading negative/positive sign?
- A: A leading positive/negative sign should be treated as a separate token. That is, -123 should parse as MINUS NUMBER

### Parsing
- Q: Is print; a valid statement?
- A: Yes, it means to print out nothing.

- Q: Is return; a valid statement?
- A: Yes, it indicates a return with no value in a void function.

- Q: Does B-minor permit this syntax?
```
for(i=0;i<10,j<10;i++) { ... }
```
- A: No, commas may only be used in print statements, function calls, function prototypes, and array expressions.

- Q: Can a single statement (without braces) be used after a for-loop or an if-statement?
- A: Yes, the following are valid statements, just as in C and C++:
```
for(i=0;i<10;i++) print i;
if(a) x=y; else z=w;
```

- Q: Is a single semicolon a valid statement?
- A: No.

- Q: Can an array be zero length?
- A: No - An array must be declared with a positive length.

- Q: Can an array initializer by empty?
- A: No - An initializer must either match the length of the array, or be omitted. It cannot be empty. (It also avoids the case of an empty initializer {} begin confused with an empty statement block {}.

### Typechecking

- Q: Does B-minor allow arrays of functions, functions that return functions, variables of type function, and things of that sort? 
- A: No, those should be flagged as type errors, since we wonâ€™t be implementing them in the code generation.

- Q: What sort of expression can be used to initialize the length of an array? 
- A: When an array is declared as a global or local variable, the length must be given as a constant integer. Any more complex expression should result in a type error. When an array is declared as a function parameter, it should have no length given.

- Q: What type should be assumed for a variable or function that cannot be resolved? 
- A: There is no good assumption that you can make. To avoid this problem, you should stop after the name resolution phase, if any name resolution errors are discovered.
